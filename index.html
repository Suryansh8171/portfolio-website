			<h2 style="color:#ffffff">All you should know about me</h2>
			<p style="color:#ffffff"><font size="5"> Born in 2002, raised in the city of TAJ.Been a hardworker since birth.
			  I am Suryansh Singh, creative and lively, now a student of SRMIST. Currently in first year Computer Science Engineering. When I am not studying for the Semester Exams or the Cycle Tests you will find me playing 
			  a game of Chess(usually with my dad, who is quiet an opponent). The one thing I can't leave home without is my
			  watch, due to the fact that I am pretty obssed with punctuality.


			  My Family is a big part of who I am, I belong from a Highly Educated and reputed one. My dad is the Director of Anand Engineering College Agra not to mention - IIT-Delhi pass out, (late)Grandfather  Aerospace Engineer who worked under Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. Mom is a House Lady the one I love the most.


			  I am a dedicated student towards a successful future(well I hope so.)
			  I am a big Theists, praying daily without any lapse is one of my major tasks.     </font>

	<p style="color:#808080"> <font size="5">Well being just a first year student, I can't define my work as skills, it is just some things I worked on in my free time. <br>
		-I know how to solve problem based questions in two languages JAVA and C. JAVA,  i studied  long time back and C recently. 
		worked on them, executing programs.<br> 
		-OutSide the syllabus i have a basic knowledge of JAVASCRIPT. I made notes, but I don't how much i remember.<br>
        -As there is no section of (skills you lack), I am an underachiever<br> when it comes to academic results, theory being my weakest part.<br> 
        -Outside books, My dad tells me that I am pretty good at chess. <br>I don't know will it be considered as a skill.</font>
